# Overview 

This project was a demonstration a full stack web application with a private, permissioned blockchain network (Hyperledger Fabric) as a backend. The IBM Blockchain Platform VSCode extension increased speed of development with tools for network management, smart contract creation, and faster smart contract deployment. Additionally, the tool Minifab allowed for testing and comprehension of a production scale, distribute, peer-to-peer blockchain network running in a virtualized environment.
